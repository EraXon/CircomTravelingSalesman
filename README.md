# CircomTravelingSalesman

A simple Circom application that builds a circuit that takes as public knowledge a graph given as an adjency matrix and provided a path as a an array it builds a zero knoweledge proof that checks whether the publicly known matrix allows for a hamiltonian path.

The intuiton behind this application was that by understanding what zero knowledge proofs are all NP problems should allow for certificates by using the inherent properties of the NP class.
